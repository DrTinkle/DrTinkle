# Hi there, I'm Roy

Welcome to my GitHub! I'm passionate about coding, problem-solving, and creating meaningful digital experiences through technology. Below, you'll find a collection of my personal projects that reflect my interests in software development, game design, and data analysis.

## Featured Projects

### [SportsBetSim](https://github.com/drtinkle/SportsBetSim) (Active development)

A browser based betting simulator game built with React. An independent project designed to showcase what I learned from the courses:
- *"The Complete JavaScript Course 2024: From Zero to Expert"* 
- *"React 18 Course 2024 - Learn React JS the fast way"*
  
SportsBetSim dynamically generates sports matchups and odds, allowing users to place bets and experience the mechanics of odds and payouts in a simulated betting environment.

## Contributions

### [steamdata](https://github.com/mmononen/steamdata) (Group project)
For the SteamData project, I created the MySQL server on Azure Cloud, set up the tables and database structure, and wrote conversion scripts to insert data into the database. Additionally, I developed a backend interface to import, filter, export, and upload data to the database. I also created a comprehensive diagram for the entire project, which you can check out [here](https://mmononen.github.io/steamdata/).

## Website Development

I have designed and developed several websites, each tailored to specific business needs:

- [acornbusinessbuyers.com](https://acornbusinessbuyers.com)  
  This site includes the **City/State SEO Plugin** I developed, along with an admin area that allows the owners to manage seller profiles. The site also features financial detail calculations for various business buyout models (currently a work in progress).

- [benergybuys.com](https://benergybuys.com)  
  A simplified version of Acorn Business Buyers with enhanced visuals. It also incorporates my **City/State SEO Plugin** for better local search optimization.

- [glowo.net](https://glowo.net)  
  A Finnish recruitment agency website. I maintained the front-end visuals and automated the article creation process to streamline content updates.
